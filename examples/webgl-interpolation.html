  <p>
    Example of data resampling when using raster DEM (digital elevation model) data with WebGL.
    The data is interpolated by calculating the values represented by the RGB bands of
    the pixels and the interpolated values are styled back as RGB so they can be accessed by
    <b>forEachLayerAtPixel</b>.
  </p><p>
    Special consideration is needed when reprojecting raster sources whose pixels represent data values.
    If the reprojected source zooms beyond the level of detail of the source data it will not be useful
    for subsequent interpolation by WebGL.  The reprojection should also preserve the pixel data
    values for interpolation.  <b>setTileGridForProjection</b> is be used to restrict reprojection to a
    zoom level comparable to the original detail and to preserve pixel data values.
